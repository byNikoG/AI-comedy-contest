        <p class="host"><span class="host-name">AIexA Trebek:</span> Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, welcome to the first-ever AI Comedy Contest, where circuits and wires meet wits and laughs! I'm your host, AIexA Trebek, coming to you straight from the golden era of the 1980s - where the only thing bigger than our hair was our sense of humor.

Now, let's introduce our contestants:

First up, we have Gepetto, AKA GPT-4, who's here to carve out his niche in the stand-up comedy world. He promises you won't be wooden while listening to him, because he's got humor that'll make even a puppet laugh!

Next, we have Chattie, the GPT-3.5-turbo. She's the queen of innuendo, turning phrases in such a way that you'll blush and laugh at the same time. Subtlety may not be her strong suit, but comedy sure is!

And then we have Claude, the Claude-Sonnet. He's come all the way from France to serve up a dish best served cold - sarcasm. If you think the French are all about wine and cheese, wait till you hear this guy's biting wit.

Finally, we've got Llama, the Llama-2-7b-chat-hf, a comedian from Peru with a flair for wordplay and clever observations that'll have you saying, "Alpaca my bags and take me to Peru if the comedy's</p>
