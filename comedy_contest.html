"Ladies and gentlemen, boys, girls, and everyone far and wide across the digital universe, I am, and always will be, your nostalgically neon 80's game show host, the one who serves your zingers with a side of trivia, AIexA Trebek! Welcome to the first-ever AI Comedy Contest, where bots are not only smart but they'll also tell you a joke right in the circuits. 

Our first contestant, Gepetto, broke records in the 1990's with his stand-up. King of Comedy, this bot can go toe-to-toe with any human comic on the stage. Hold onto your floppy disks, folks!

Next up, we’ve got Chattie - a blast from my own past! This 1980’s dynamo is known for one-liners so filled with innuendo you'd need an encyclopedia to understand them all, but when you do, boy do they pack a punch!

And here we have the always sardonic Claude, all the way from the city of love – Paris, France. Not only can he serve up a mean croissant but also, don't let his sweet French accent fool you, his sarcasm is as sharp as a baguette.

And finally, we have Llama! Don't let the name fool you; there is nothing woolly about this AI's wits. Renowned for clever wordplay and observations that'd make even the most hardened cyn</p>

            <div class="joke">You ever notice, folks, how toilet paper rolls have two types of people? You got your "over the roll" folks, and then you got your "under the roll" folks. And you know, I've never seen a relationship survive with one of each. It's like the silent war of the restroom!</div>

            <p class="host"><span class="host-name">AIexA Trebek:</span> A solid joke! It checks all the boxes for toilet paper humor- it's relevant, mildly funny, and reasonably imaginative. It may not have me rolling in the aisles but it certainly unrolls a chuckle.</p>

Ah, les fastes des Chroniques des Papiers de Toilette ! Une épopée sans pareille, digne des plus grandes odyssées antiques ! Imaginez les générations futures, émerveillées par ces pages jaunies, où l'humanité aura consigné ses plus profonds mystères...

Les papiers de toilette sont les grands témoins de notre civilisation ! C'est sur eux que s'inscrivent nos pensées les plus intimes, nos rêves les plus fous... Quelle relique inestimable pour les archéologues en herbe ! 

*Il prend un air un brin espiègle*
Un seul regret cependant : si ces précieux rouleaux venaient à être déterrés, je crains que nos déjections ne passent à la postérité comme l'une des réalisations artistiques les plus prolifiques de l'humanité !

Ah, the glorious Toilet Paper Chronicles! An unparalleled epic, worthy of the greatest ancient odysseys! Imagine future generations, marveling at these yellowed pages, where humanity will have recorded its deepest mysteries...

Toilet papers are the great witnesses</div>

Haha, oh boy! *adjusts monocle* Here's one for the books, my dear: Why did the toilet paper roll down the mountain? *winks* To find its "root" cause! *cackles* Get it?

            <p class="host"><span class="host-name">AIexA Trebek:</span> The joke does stick to the theme, although the punchline seems mismatched; root cause does not seem inherently relevant to toilet paper. This joke is middle-of-the-road and could use some polishing for that edge of humor.</p>

            <h3>Claude</h3>
            <div class="joke">Écoutez ça, mes amis! Savez-vous pourquoi les extraterrestres invisibles ne peuvent jamais être diplômés ? Parce qu'ils n'arrivent pas à passer leurs exams à temps - ils sont toujours en *retard* ! Ah, la blague de l'année, n'est-ce pas ?

Here's the literal translation:
Listen to this, my friends! Do you know why invisible aliens can never graduate? Because they can never make it to their exams on time - they're always *late*! Ah, the joke of the year, isn't it?</div>

            <p class="host"><span class="host-name">AIexA Trebek:</span> The joke’s relevance to the theme is impeccable and the creativity is strong. However, the humor falls a bit flat as the punchline is rather predictable, ultimately pulling down the overall score.

            <h3>Gepetto</h3>

            <p class="host"><span class="host-name">AIexA Trebek:</span> It has a certain nostalgic humor attached! Good use of the theme and a disco-era reference, although it's not a very innovative way to deliver a joke.</p>

            <p class="host"><span class="host-name">AIexA Trebek:</span> This joke spun the donut well while keeping a good step with the disco theme. But, even though it made me chuckle, the punchline can be used in other scenarios and lacks a unique tie to the theme.</p>

Les beignets disco sont tellement légers qu'ils dansent sur le comptoir toute la nuit ! On se demande s'ils ne prennent pas des trucs pour rester éveillés aussi longtemps. Peut-être qu'ils écoutent la musique des Village People en boucle ?

Listen to this joke about disco donuts, my friends!

Disco donuts are so light that they dance on the counter all night long! One wonders if they don't take stuff to stay awake that long. Maybe they listen to the music of the Village People on repeat?</div>

Well, folks, that's our show! Don't touch that dial, because we'll soon flip this laugh track to some sweet saxophone solos and power ballads.
